It is easier to work from Version 2 backward. However, not all features can be 
used in Version 1 files. The following is the list of instructions to convert
the Version 2 file to a Version 1 file.

0. Overwrite Version 1 file contents with Version 2 file contents.
1. Remove/exchange Version 2 constants
  a. Exchange all "ActiveColor" and "InactiveColor" constants with hard-coded values.
2. Comment out/Remove all Version 2 Buttons in the frame_style sections.
